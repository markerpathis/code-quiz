# Code Quiz!

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a code quiz to test the user's knowledge on the fundaments of JavaScript. The quiz starts when the user clicks the start button after the page is loaded. The quiz includes 5 questions and the user has 60 seconds on the timer. After an answer is clicked, the quiz will progress. But if the selected answer is incorrect, 10 seconds will be taken from the timer.

The quiz ends when the user has answered all 5 questions or there is no time remaining on the timer. The final score is the time remaining on the timer. So if the user does not complete the quiz, their final score will be 0.

The user will then be prompted to enter their initials to save their score on the leaderboard. The leaderboard entry will be saved to local storage. The leaderboard will then be rendered and the leaderboard entries will be sorted in descending order if there are more than one in local storage.

From the leaderboard, the user is able to take the quiz again to try and get a better score. Or they can refresh the page.
